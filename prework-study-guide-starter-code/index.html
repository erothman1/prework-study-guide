        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML): handles content, structure, and meaning of each element on a page of a website.</li>
          <li>HTML allows us to build a sturdy frame for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with ankle brackets.</li>
          <li>Tags contain everything we want to include in the element.</li>
          <li>To add content to the page, we can use text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements.</li>
          <li>To divide or describe content, we can use meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>The parent element holds all of the children.</li>

          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements within the head are not visible to the user.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, a title element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization(SEO).</li>
          <li>We can also use style elements, base elements, link elements, meta elements, and script elements inside the head element.</li>
          <li>Style elements define the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>Base elements define the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>Link elements connect an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Meta elements define metadata such as character set, page description, keywords, author, and viewport settings.</li>
          <li>Script elements embed client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
      
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>All of the elements placed inside the body are seen and interacted with by the user. </li>
          <li>A body element is an example of a semantic element.</li>
          <li>A semantic HTML element describes its content and role with its name.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 elements represent the level of headings a given text bloc represents.</li>
          <li>The h1 element will have the largest text.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a pararagph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul element represents an unordered, or bulleted list.</li>
          <li>The ol element represents an ordered, or numbered, list.</li>
          <li>The li element represents list items.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage and can contain various attributes.</li>
          <li>The src attribute in an img element defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt attrubute in an image element contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creares a line of empty space, or a line break, between two elements of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

          <li>The html opening tag represents the root or start of the HTML document. </li>
          <li>Tags can contain attributes, which defines additional information.</li>
          <li>Elements and tags are commonly used interchangeably, but there is a difference.</li>
          <li>Elements are the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
          <li>Tag refers only to what appears insde the ankle brackets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS): programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style CSS: inline, external, and internal</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file </li>
          <li>Internal CSS: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file </li>
          <li>External CSS: allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier </li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is with external CSS</li>

          <li>Everything in CSS has a box around it, consisting of margins outside the element and the elements borders, padding, and content</li>
          <li>Margin: indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>Padding: indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Content box: the area where your content is displayed</li>
          <li>Border box: the border wraps the content and any padding</li>
          <li>There is the Standard CSS Box Model and the Alternative CSS Box Model</li>
          <li>In a Standard Box Model, you add the padding and border to the width and height to get the dimensions of the total size taken up by the box</li>
          <li>In the Alternative Box Model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page</li>

          <li>Margin collapsing when you have two elements with margins that touch</li>
          <li>Two positive margins will combine to become one margin equal to the largest of the individual margins</li>
          <li>Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest(furthest from zero) will be used </li>
          <li>If one margin is negative, its value will be subtracted from the total </li>

        </ul>
